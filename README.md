Logistic Regression and Confussion Matrix
#------------
Logistic Regression 
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, which means it is employed when the outcome variable (the one you want to predict) has two possible classes or labels, typically represented as 0 and 1
 Confussion Matrix
A confusion matrix is a table that is used to evaluate the performance of a classification algorithm. It provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions and how they compare to the actual true values. A confusion matrix is particularly useful in binary classification problems, where there are two classes or categories, such as "positive" and "negative."

The confusion matrix contains four important metrics:

True Positives (TP): The number of samples that were correctly predicted as positive. In other words, the model correctly identified instances of the positive class.

True Negatives (TN): The number of samples that were correctly predicted as negative. The model correctly identified instances of the negative class.

False Positives (FP): The number of samples that were incorrectly predicted as positive. These are instances that the model predicted as positive but were actually negative. This is also known as a Type I error or a "false alarm."

False Negatives (FN): The number of samples that were incorrectly predicted as negative. These are instances that the model predicted as negative but were actually positive. This is also known as a Type II error or a "miss."
